# LG-UHC Plugin for Spigot 1.8

## Introduction
Welcome to the LG-UHC plugin, a customizable plugin for Minecraft servers running on Spigot 1.8. This plugin allows any server owner to host their own LG-UHC games, a unique blend of the classic "Loup-Garou de Thiercelieux" (Werewolf) and Ultra Hardcore (UHC) gameplay.

## Note on the code quality
This plugin was my first project in Java, marking the beginning of my journey in software development. Reflecting my learning curve, the early versions of this code were written before I fully grasped object-oriented programming. It stands as a testament to my evolution as a developer, showing progress and a willingness to learn and improve.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Minecraft server running Spigot 1.8.X.

### Installation
1. **Download the Plugin:** Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/BGoodes/lguhc-old/releases) section of this GitHub repository. Download the latest `.jar` file available.
2. **Server Setup:** Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `plugins` directory of your Minecraft server.
3. **Server Restart:** Restart your Minecraft server. After the restart, the plugin should be loaded and operational.

## Contribution and Support
As this project is no longer actively maintained, community contributions and support are welcome. This plugin is completely open-source, released without restrictions. Feel free to fork, modify, and redistribute in line with your own projects.

Special thanks to Setrox, TheGuill84, and Lapin, the original creators of the LG-UHC game mode. Their innovative ideas have laid the groundwork for this plugin.
